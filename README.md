## Introduction

This repository focuses on simple linear regression, demonstrating how to create and train models from scratch using **PyTorch**. This project also covers key data science libraries:
- **PyTorch** for building and training the model.
- **scikit-learn** for loading datasets and evaluation metrics.
- **NumPy** and **Pandas** for data manipulation.

Every step, from data loading to model evaluation, is accompanied by explanations in markdown cells within the Jupyter notebooks, ensuring an in-depth understanding.

## PyTorch Fundamentals

This project introduces key PyTorch concepts such as:
- **Tensors** for data representation.
- **Autograd** for automatic differentiation.
- **Loss functions** and **optimizers** to guide the learning process.

These fundamentals are covered within the notebooks in a hands-on format, ensuring you understand the purpose of each component.

## Usage

To get started, open the notebooks in `notebooks/`, where you’ll find step-by-step guidance through:
1. **Loading and preparing data**.
2. **Defining the linear regression model** in PyTorch.
3. **Training and evaluating** the model on sample datasets.

Each notebook is designed as an exercise with ample markdown explanations to help you learn interactively.
